## Composer

To install Administrator as a Composer package to be used with Laravel 5, simply run:

```sh
composer require "rudrarajiv/flipbook-laravel: 5.*"
```

Once it's installed, you can register the service provider in `app/config/app.php` in the `providers` array:

```php
'providers' => [
	'rudrarajiv\flipbook-laravel\FlipbookServiceProvider',
]
```

Then publish Administrator's assets with `php artisan vendor:publish`. This will add assets in  `public` , migrations in `database` and views in `resources` . This [config file](http://administrator.frozennode.com/docs/configuration) is the primary way you interact with Administrator. This command will also publish all of the assets, views, and translation files.
